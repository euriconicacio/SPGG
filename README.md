# Single Point GEM [Global Earth Models] Generator - SPGG - v 2.1

SPGG is a standalone application that enables the user to generate multiple point-to-point extracts of Global Geopotential Models with direct access to the web calculation service of the International Centre for Global Earth Models ([ICGEM](http://icgem.gfz-potsdam.de/ICGEM/)), which is one of five services coordinated by the International Gravity Field Service ([IGFS](http://igfs.topo.auth.gr/)) of the  International Association of Geodesy ([IAG](http://www.iag-aig.org/)).
